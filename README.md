Infrastructure Automation Playbooks 

Some assorted Ansible and Terraform infrastructure automation playbooks and shell scripts I find useful for my daily activities as a Storage System Engineer.

## Installation
Prior to running any scripts I recommend you install ansible and terraform.  All ansible modules required can be installed by running the playbook

```bash
linux/all-linux-ansible-install.yml
```
